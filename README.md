A Norwegian version of [Italian number practice](https://github.com/Dot32IsCool/italian-numbers), this time build in rust!

### Building and Running
- Install Rust; download it [here]() or install it with your systems package manager (`brew install rust` for MacOS)
- Download or clone this repository
- `cd` into the project directory and run `cargo run --release`

### Basics of counting in Norwegian
Counting to ten:
1. én
2. to
3. tre
4. fire
5. fem
6. seks
7. sju
8. åtte
9. ni
10. ti

Similarily to English, numbers larger than 20 are written as [ten][unit], eg fifty five. <br>
Unlike in English however, Norwegian doesnt seperate the words; fifty five would instead be fiftyfive.

In norwegian, the tens go as such:<br>
20. tjue <br>
30. tretti <br>
40. førti<br>
50. femti<br>
60. seksti<br>
70. sytti <br>
80. åtti<br>
90. nitti<br>

As such, you would write "55" as femtifem, "44" as førtifire, etc. Unlike in Italian, no special rules are applied to "1" and "8" digits (which thankfully made this app easier to code).

Just like English and Italian, the teens (10 - 20), are unique from other numbers, however at least the Norwegian teens somewhat resemble english teens (elleve is elleven, seksten is sixteen, ect), unlike Italian teens! 

Build and run the project to learn 10-20 and 100!
